        <h3>CHOOSING PROJECTS</h3>

        <p>We were provided with lot of projects, and we had to choose as many as we want. Since I knew java, I tried contributing to projects that were java based(Android).
I tried projects such as Health Log and the OTES App. Both were based on the current pandemic situation and provided efficient ways to tackle them. </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Addition of swiping or sliding features between the four activity.This will enable the user to move forward from one activity to another not only by the next button provided but also by swiping the screens.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Inserted a video player in activity_disaster1.xml, activity_disaster2.xml, activity_disaster3.xml, activity_disaster4.xml so that the video link is replaced by the actual video that will be played at the same position. The video player would fetch the video directly from YouTube( this would maintain the apk size i.e. it's size won't increse due to the addition of videos).</p>

        <h3>MY THOUGHTS</h3>
        <p>My experience contributing in Kharagpur Winter of Code has been quite good. Although I couldnt contribute much but still learnt a lot of new things.I also learnt the mannerism of communicating with mentors and all the people associated with this.</p>
